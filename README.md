# Transportation Simplex Algorithm


# Transportation Simplex Algorithm

Implementation of the Transportation Simplex Algorithm for solving transportation problems in linear programming.

---

## Problem Statement

The transportation problem is a special case of linear programming where goods must be transported from multiple sources to multiple destinations at minimum cost, subject to supply and demand constraints.

This project implements the **Transportation Simplex Algorithm**, exploiting the problem’s structure for efficient solution.
